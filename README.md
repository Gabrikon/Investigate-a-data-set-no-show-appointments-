# Investigate No-show Appointments

## Overview

This project aims to analyze a dataset related to medical appointments and investigate factors that contribute to patient no-shows. By exploring the data, we can gain insights into appointment adherence and potentially improve healthcare systems.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis contains information about medical appointments, including patient demographics, appointment dates, and other relevant features. It is essential to understand the data structure before diving into the analysis.

## Research Questions

1. **What are the key features associated with appointment no-shows?**
2. **Is there any correlation between patient characteristics (e.g., age, gender, health conditions) and no-show rates?**
3. **How does the time gap between scheduling an appointment and the actual appointment date impact attendance?**

## Processes

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**
   - Handle missing values.
   - Convert date columns to appropriate formats.
   - Remove outliers (if any).

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Visualize appointment trends.
   - Explore patient demographics.
   - Investigate relationships between variables.

3. **Statistical Analysis:**
   - Conduct statistical tests to identify significant factors.
   - Calculate descriptive statistics.

4. **Predictive Modeling (Yet to be completd):**
   - Build a predictive model (e.g., logistic regression) to predict no-show probabilities.
   - Evaluate model performance.

## Results

Summarize your findings based on the analysis. Highlight any patterns or insights related to appointment no-shows. Use visualizations (e.g., bar charts, histograms) to enhance understanding.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, understanding the factors influencing no-show appointments is crucial for healthcare providers. By addressing these factors, we can improve patient attendance rates and enhance overall healthcare delivery.
